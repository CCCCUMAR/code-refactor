# Code-refactor Assignment

## Description 
```
 For this assignment the goal was to make a pre-fabricated website more accesible. 
 To accomplish this a few thing needed to be done. The old  code did not utilize semantic tags so the first task was 
 to fix that and make use of more semantic tags such as header and section. Other things that had to be done included 
 the inclusion of specific alt attributes to all images and icons, and adding comments on both the hmtl and css to make 
 them more accesible later.
```
